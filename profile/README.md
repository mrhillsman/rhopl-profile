## Overview

OpenShift Partner Labs enables users and lab managers to self-service lab environments through a web interface. Under the hood, every component communicates exclusively through a central message broker — no direct coupling, no shared state, no tight dependencies. Workers are stateless and horizontally scalable. A single DB Writer owns all database mutations, providing a complete audit trail and eliminating race conditions.

The system is **language-agnostic by design**. Each component is an isolated container that publishes and subscribes to messages. The implementing team selects a primary language for consistency, but individual components can diverge when there's a compelling reason.

### `portal`

> Frontend web application

The user-facing interface where users submit lab requests and lab managers administer environments. Publishes all commands to the message broker. Reads lab state from Postgres via a **read-only** database connection.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Client-side form validation
- Publish commands to the broker (e.g., `lab-request-submitted`, `deprovision-requested`)
- Display lab status, history, and configuration from the database
- Polling or WebSocket updates for near-real-time state changes

**Does not:**
- Write to the database
- Communicate with workers directly
- Contain business logic beyond input validation

---

### `queue`

> Message broker configuration and schemas

Everything related to the central message broker — queue definitions, topic/routing configuration, dead-letter queue setup, TTL policies, and connection credentials management.

**Contents:**
- Broker configuration files (exchanges, queues, bindings, policies)
- Dead-letter queue and TTL configuration
- Authentication and permission setup
- Health check and monitoring endpoints
- Docker Compose or Helm config for local/dev broker instances

**Broker requirements:**
- Message persistence until acknowledged
- TTL with dead-letter routing for timeout detection
- Topic-based routing to dispatch messages to correct workers
- Source validation on incoming connections

> [!NOTE]
> The broker technology is not yet decided. Candidates: RabbitMQ, NATS, AWS SQS/SNS. See [`docs`](#docs) for the ADR.

---

### `workers`

> Stateless queue workers

All domain-specific workers live in this repo as separate modules/packages, each with its own entry point and Dockerfile. Workers share a common contract but are independently deployable and scalable.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph workers repo
        W_Prov[worker-provisioning]
        W_Deprov[worker-deprovision]
        W_Notify[worker-notification]
        W_Day1[worker-day-one]
        W_Day2[worker-day-two]
    end

    Q{Message Broker} --> W_Prov
    Q --> W_Deprov
    Q --> W_Notify
    Q --> W_Day1
    Q --> W_Day2

    W_Prov -.-> Q
    W_Deprov -.-> Q
    W_Notify -.-> Q
    W_Day1 -.-> Q
    W_Day2 -.-> Q
```

**Worker contract — every worker must:**
- Be stateless (no in-memory state between messages)
- Be idempotent (processing the same message twice produces the same result)
- Publish a status message on job start (`*-started`) and completion (`*-complete` / `*-failed`)
- Be horizontally scalable (N instances competing for messages)

| Worker | Subscribes To | Publishes |
|---|---|---|
| `worker-provisioning` | `provision-lab` | `provisioning-started`, `provisioning-complete`, `provisioning-failed` |
| `worker-deprovision` | `deprovision-lab` | `deprovision-started`, `deprovision-complete`, `deprovision-failed` |
| `worker-notification` | `notify-user-*`, `notify-admin-*` | `notification-sent`, `notification-failed` |
| `worker-day-one` | `run-day-one-setup` | `day-one-started`, `day-one-complete`, `day-one-failed` |
| `worker-day-two` | `run-day-two-ops` | `day-two-started`, `day-two-complete`, `day-two-failed` |

**Suggested repo structure:**
```

├── worker-provisioning/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── src/
│   └── tests/
├── worker-deprovision/
│   ├── Dockerfile

│   └── tests/
└── README.md
```

> [!TIP]
> Adding a new worker? Create a new directory, implement the worker contract, subscribe to the appropriate topic, and deploy. No changes to any other component required.

---

### `scribe`

> DB Writer — event sink service

The single-instance service that owns **all writes** to Postgres. Subscribes to state-changing events on the broker, validates and deduplicates them, and serializes state changes into the database. Also publishes follow-on commands after successful writes (e.g., after recording `provisioning-complete`, publishes `notify-user-lab-ready` and `run-day-one-setup`).

**Key responsibilities:**
- Subscribe to all state-changing broker events
- Deduplicate requests (idempotency key check)
- Enforce state machine transitions
- Manage retry logic (count, backoff, escalation)
- Write all state transitions with timestamps for audit trail
- Publish follow-on commands to trigger downstream workers

**Scaling path:**
The default deployment is a single instance. For higher throughput, the documented scale-out path is **partitioned writers** — run N instances each owning a partition by entity ID hash. See ADR-006 in [`docs`](#docs).

```mermaid

    Q{Message Broker} -->|all state events| S[Scribe - DB Writer]

    style Q fill:#2a1a2e,stroke:#a855f7,color:#d8b4fe
```

---

### `datastore`

> Database schema, migrations, and tooling

Owns the Postgres schema definition, migration scripts, seed data for development, and backup/restore tooling. This is the **only repo that defines the database structure**. The `scribe` service consumes the schema; it does not define it.

**Contents:**
- Migration scripts (versioned, idempotent)
- Schema definition (tables, indexes, constraints)
- Seed data for local development
- Backup and restore scripts
- Database role definitions (read-write for `scribe`, read-only for `portal`)

**Core tables (starting point):**
- `labs` — lab records with state machine status
- `lab_events` — audit log of all state transitions
- `notifications` — notification delivery log
- `retry_tracking` — retry counts, backoff state, dead-letter records

> [!NOTE]
> Migration tooling is not yet selected. Candidates: Flyway, Alembic, golang-migrate, dbmate.

---

### `commons`

> Shared library

Language-neutral definitions and shared utilities consumed by all other repos. If the team uses a single language, this is a native package. If polyglot, these are schema definitions (JSON Schema, Protobuf, or Avro) with per-language generated clients.

**Contents:**
- Message schema definitions (all event types, required fields, versioning)
- Broker client wrapper (publish, subscribe, acknowledge)
- Constants (event type strings, status values, queue names)
- Shared types/interfaces

**Message contract — every message must include:**
```
event_type       string     e.g., "lab-request-submitted"
event_id         UUID       deduplication and tracing
timestamp        ISO 8601   UTC
source           string     publishing component identifier
payload          object     event-specific data
correlation_id   UUID       links all events in a single workflow
version          string     schema version
```

---

### `messenger`

> Slack/Teams notification bot

An optional but recommended component that extends the `worker-notification` capabilities with interactive messaging. Can subscribe directly to broker events or be triggered by the notification worker.

**Capabilities:**
- Send lab provisioning status updates to Slack/Teams channels
- Interactive commands (e.g., `/lab status`, `/lab request`, `/lab deprovision`)
- Approval workflows for lab managers via message buttons
- Escalation alerts for failures and timeouts

> [!NOTE]
> This is an extension component. The core notification worker handles email and basic alerts. `messenger` adds rich interactive messaging.

---

### `infra`

> Infrastructure as Code

All cloud infrastructure defined as code — broker clusters, database instances, networking, IAM, container registries, and secrets management.

**Contents:**
- IaC modules (broker, database, networking, compute)
- Environment configurations (dev, staging, production)
- Secrets management setup
- Network segmentation (private subnets for broker/DB/workers; public for portal)

> [!NOTE]
> IaC tooling is not yet selected. Candidates: Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CDK.

---

### `deploy`

> Kubernetes manifests and GitOps configuration

Deployment definitions for all components — manifests, Helm charts, and GitOps controller configuration. The GitOps controller watches this repo and reconciles cluster state.

**Contents:**
- Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts for every component
- HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) configs for workers
- GitOps controller configuration (ArgoCD applications or Flux kustomizations)
- Environment overlays (dev, staging, production)
- Health check and readiness probe definitions

### `docs`

> Documentation hub

Central documentation for the platform — system design, architecture decision records, runbooks, onboarding guides, and operational procedures.

**Contents:**
- `system-design.md` — comprehensive system design document
- `adr/` — architecture decision records (ADR-001 through ADR-006+)
- `runbooks/` — operational procedures (deploy, rollback, incident response)
- `onboarding/` — getting started guides for new contributors

## Design Principles

| Principle | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| **Decoupled by default** | Every component communicates through the broker. Adding or removing a component requires zero changes to others. |
| **Stateless workers** | Workers carry no state between messages. Scale any worker type by adding instances. |
| **Single writer** | Only `scribe` writes to the database. No race conditions, no distributed transactions, full audit trail. |
| **Language agnostic** | Any language that can pub/sub on the broker works. The shared contract is the message schema, not a code dependency. |
| **GitOps everything** | Git is the source of truth for infrastructure, deployment, and configuration. All changes via PR. |
| **Observable** | Structured logs with correlation IDs, metrics on queue depth and processing time, alerts on failures and timeouts. |

## Contributing

1. Check [`docs`](#docs) for architecture context and ADRs before proposing changes
2. Open an issue in the relevant repo to discuss before starting work
3. Follow the branching strategy: `feature/*` → PR → `develop` → `main`
4. All PRs require review and passing CI
5. Update documentation in [`docs`](#docs) for any architectural changes

> [!TIP]
> **Adding a new worker type?** See the [workers](#workers) section. Create a new module, implement the worker contract, subscribe to a topic, deploy. No changes to other components.
>
> **Proposing an architectural change?** Write an RFC in [`docs`](#docs) and open it for discussion before implementation.
